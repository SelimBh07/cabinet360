## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Database

### Database Structure

```
cabinet360_saas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lawyers (tenant table)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin_users
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clients (with lawyer_id FK)

$_SESSION['lawyer_id']        // Current lawyer ID
$_SESSION['cabinet_name']     // Cabinet name
$_SESSION['lawyer_name']      // Lawyer name
$_SESSION['lawyer_email']     // Email
