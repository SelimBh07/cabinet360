## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Multi-Tenancy
Each lawyer is a "tenant" with their own isolated data. The `lawyer_id` column in all tables ensures data separation.

### Session Management
```php
$_SESSION['lawyer_id']        // Current lawyer
$_SESSION['cabinet_name']     // Cabinet name
$_SESSION['subscription_plan'] // Current plan
```

### Security
- Passwords: bcrypt hashed
- SQL: Prepared statements
- XSS: htmlspecialchars
- Sessions: HttpOnly cookies
- Audit: Activity logs

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor activity logs** regularly in admin panel
2. **Backup database** daily (especially lawyers table)
3. **Test on staging** before production changes
4. **Enable HTTPS** for production
5. **Change default passwords** immediately
6. **Review subscription limits** based on your market
7. **Consider email notifications** for better UX
